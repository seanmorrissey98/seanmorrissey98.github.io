                        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center">The purpose of this therapeutic discipline is to bring biomagnetic<br>balance to all the organs tissues and areas of the body that are out of<br>biomagnetic balance with the body’s magnetic field and also the earths magnetic<br>field.
                            To balance all the microbes in the body, viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites.<br>Microbes make up 85 % of the dna of the body and when they are unwell or out of<br>balance they tend to cause illness. Unbalanced microbes can
                            cause harm in the<br>body whereas those that are balanced contribute to the biological functioning<br>of the body as well as playing a vital role in the bodys immune and defence<br>system.<br></p>

                        <p class="text-center d-flex justify-content-center">Biomagnetic Therapy<br>is a safe, gentle and very effective therapy with practically no side effects<br>and completly compatible with other traditional and alternative practices. One<br>of the best things for me is I am tuning
                            in to the person themselves to get the<br>answers and not relying on symptoms alone, i'm getting the answer from the<br>person by using bioresonance scanning and this tells me what needs to be<br>balanced in their bodies to
                            bring them back to full health.<br><br>while current traditional<br>medicine practices target the symptoms or degenerative signs that are caused by<br>a single pathogen and do not target additional pathogens that are also part
                            of<br>the disease illness process. This therapy is used to successfully find the<br>origin of a persons problem even if the source of the problem hasnt deveoped<br>any symtoms yet and is therefore preventative for complex chronic
                            degenerative<br>diseases, syndromes and tumors that negatively affect a persons health.<br></p>

                    <p class="description">I<br>had seen my GP more times than I could count, medical assessment unit numerous<br>times. Referred to specialist after specialist, test after test, NO HELP, NO<br>DIAGNOSIS. I was in trouble, my health was declining. I eventually
                        was<br>diagnosed in Germany -- Borrelia (Lyme disease). What now?? Try Applied Bio<br>magnetic Therapy I had nothing to lose. 1 year later -no symptoms, I was part<br>of the human race again. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to this
                        remarkable<br>therapy and its founder Dr Raymond Cadwell.<br></p><a class="action" href="#"></a></div>

                        with Kieron<br>and the infections gone! 6 months later and I havent had an antibiotic and no<br>hospital visit. (Elizabeth)<br></p><a class="action" href="#"></a></div>

                        the<br>spots were going and not coming back .The Red marks on my face are shrinking<br>aswell. (second level student)<br></p><a class="action" href="#"></a></div>

Underneath our biochemical exterior the<br>lightspeed
                            communication between micro-organisms and cells, our thoughts and<br>emotions are all electromagnetic. Every microbe cell organ and emotion has its<br>own fingerprint frequency. The full spectrum forms the human resonanance
                            field.<br>During the bioresonance scan we are relying on all of the biological systems of<br>the body to communicate, coherence, low coherence or chaos and each of the<br>scanning points has its own unique vibrational frequency
                            and signature.<br><br>It has been<br>shown scientifically that "there is a strong probability that most of the<br>biological systems within the body can only function if there is a coherence at<br>the atomic, sub atomic, molecule
                            and cell level. (Seth Lloyd,2011) Our<br>assumption is that all biological systems need coherence over chaos in order to<br>function in a healthful and life enhancing way.<br><br>So our goal<br>for all our clients is to bring

                            on a treatment<br>table. You will be given open toed shoes with a flat heel to wear during the<br>session, This enables easy identification of foot-leg movements when held by<br>the therapist during the bioresonance scan.<br><br>This
                            leg<br>length imbalance enables the therapist to identify areas of the body that<br>indicate the prescence of harmful pathogens, dysfunctions (organ, glandular and<br>hormonal) and other issues which are then treated by placing
                            and taping pairs<br>of magnets on specific locations on the body to restore balance.<br><br>When the body<br>has been fully scanned the magnets are left on for approx 20 minutes. The<br>entire session takes around 1 1/2 hours
                            for the initial consultation and about<br>an hour for follow up sessions.<br><br>Most of our clients<br>feel relaxed during the process while some report feeling a tingling sensation<br>or a vibration.<br><br>As the<br>session
                            concludes we remove the magnets and give you some feedback about what<br>has shown up during your treatment. We can then schedule follow up appointments<br>as needed and at follow up appointments we can review any changes to
