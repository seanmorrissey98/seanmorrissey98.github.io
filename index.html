		<h2>Previous patients:</h2>
		<h3>LYME DISEASE</h3>
		<p>I had seen my GP more times than I could count,Medical assesment unit numerous
times. Referred to specialist after specialist,test aftertest,NO HELP,NO DIAGNOSIS.
I was in trouble, my health was declining. I eventually was diagnosed in Germany --
Borrelia (Lyme disease).
What now?? Try Applied Biomagnetic Therapy I had nothing to lose. 1 year later -no

symptoms, I was part ofthe human race again. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to this re-
markable therapy and its founder Dr Raymond Cadwell.</p>
		<h3>KIDNEY INFECTIONS</h3>
		<p>I seemed to be getting one kidney infection after another and wasnt getting much break
between courses of antibiotics. I was very concerned as I was due to go in to hospital to
have the cause investigated. I had 4 treatments with Kieron and the infections gone!
6 months later and I havent had an antibiotic and no hospital visit. (Elizabeth)</p>
		<h3>ACNE</h3>
		<p>I was on 2 prescription medications forthe acne butI was still getting bad flare ups. I was
a bit sceptical of the magnet treatment at first. But after 2 treatments I saw an
improvement, less redness. After the 3rd treatment the spots were going and not
coming back .The Red marks on my face are shrinking aswell. (second level student)</p>
