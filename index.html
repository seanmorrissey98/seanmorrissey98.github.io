		<h2>THE BENEFITS:</h2>	
		<p><img src="images/fit.jpg" class="rightimage">Biomagnetic Therapy is a safe, gentle and very effective therapy with practically no side effects and completly compatible with other traditional and alternative practices. One of the best things for me is I am tuning in to the person themselves to get the answers and not relying on symptoms alone, i'm getting the answer from the person by using bioresonance scanning and this tells me what needs to be balanced in their bodies to bring them back to full health.</P>
		<p>while current traditional medicine practices target the symptoms or degenerative signs that are caused by a single pathogen and do not target additional pathogens that are also part of the disease illness process. This therapy is used to successfully find the origin of a persons problem even if the source of the problem hasnt deveoped any symtoms yet and is therefore preventative for complex chronic degenerative diseases, syndromes and tumors that negatively affect a persons health.</p>

		<h2>WHAT CLIENTS SAY:</h2>
		<h3>LYME DISEASE</h3>
		<p><img src="images/man.jpg"><img src="images/pic6.jpg" class="rightimage">I had seen my GP more times than I could count,Medical assesment unit numerous
times. Referred to specialist after specialist,test aftertest,NO HELP,NO DIAGNOSIS.
I was in trouble, my health was declining. I eventually was diagnosed in Germany --
Borrelia (Lyme disease).
What now?? Try Applied Biomagnetic Therapy I had nothing to lose. 1 year later -no

symptoms, I was part ofthe human race again. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to this re-
markable therapy and its founder Dr Raymond Cadwell.</p>
		<h3>KIDNEY INFECTIONS</h3>
		<p><img src="images/woman.jpg"><img src="images/pic7.jpg" class="rightimage">I seemed to be getting one kidney infection after another and wasnt getting much break
between courses of antibiotics. I was very concerned as I was due to go in to hospital to
have the cause investigated. I had 4 treatments with Kieron and the infections gone!
6 months later and I havent had an antibiotic and no hospital visit. (Elizabeth)</p>
		<h3>ACNE</h3>
		<p><img src="images/woman.jpg"><img src="images/pic8.jpg" class="rightimage">I was on 2 prescription medications forthe acne butI was still getting bad flare ups. I was
a bit sceptical of the magnet treatment at first. But after 2 treatments I saw an
improvement, less redness. After the 3rd treatment the spots were going and not
coming back .The Red marks on my face are shrinking aswell. (second level student)</p>

			<h2>Purpose and Objectives</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this therapeutic discipline is to bring biomagnetic balance to all the organs tissues and areas of the body that are out of biomagnetic balance with the bodyâ€™s magnetic field and also the earths magnetic field. To balance all the microbes in the body, viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites. Microbes make up 85 % of the dna of the body and when they are unwell or out of balance they tend to cause illness. Unbalanced microbes can cause harm in the body whereas those that are balanced contribute to the biological functioning of the body as well as playing a vital role in the bodys immune and defence system.</p>

			<h2>The Bioresonance Scan</h2>
			<p>Our bodies are not just a combustion engine (food+water) but also a tranciever a compendium of cells that receive and transmit information through electromagnetic frequencies. Underneath our biochemical exterior the lightspeed communication between micro-organisms and cells, our thoughts and emotions are all electromagnetic. Every microbe cell organ and emotion has its own fingerprint frequency. The full spectrum forms the human resonanance field.
During the bioresonance scan we are relying on all of the biological systems of the body to communicate, coherence, low coherence or chaos and each of the scanning points has its own unique vibrational frequency and signature. </p>
			<p>It has been shown scientifically that "there is a strong probability that most of the biological systems within the body can only function if there is a coherence at the atomic, sub atomic, molecule and cell level. (Seth Lloyd,2011)
Our assumption is that all biological systems need coherence over chaos in order to function in a healthful and life enhancing way.</p>
			<p>So our goal for all our clients is to bring balance (coherence)  to all the microbes, organs tissues and areas of the body that are out of biomagnetic balance and to Restore Your Natural Healing Ability. </p>
