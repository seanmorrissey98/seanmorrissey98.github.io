  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my site!</h3>
     <p>My name is Sean Morrissey and I am a 19 year old first year student in the University Of Limerick. I am currently studying Computer Systems and I am having a lot of fun doing so! The constant challenges and innovation requirements of the course are allowing me to enjoy my work and thus improve my skills.</p>
       
     <p>So far I have gained valuable knowledge on various modules such as: Discrete Mathematics, Computer Maths, Computer Science, Software Development, Games Development, Model-Driven Development, Computer Organisations, Databases, Operating Systems, OOP and Software Testing and Requirements.</p>
       
     <p>In my time in college so far I have completed many projects and assignments be it solo or in teams. Some of which can be viewed on my Projects page or on my <a href="https://github.com/seanmorrissey98" target="_blank">Github</a>. In some of these projects such as my League Manager application I have taken on the role of project leader, allowing me to improving various skills of mine such as delegation and organisation.</p>
       
     <p>Outside of my course and college i am an avid fan of sports, music, gaming and socializing. I am a member of various clubs and societies such as Social Soccer but my main love is for computing, so every spare minute I get is spent on furthering my knowledge or working on projects.</p>
