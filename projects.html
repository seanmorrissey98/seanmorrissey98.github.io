      <li><h3>Personal Site</h3><p>I am currently working on improving this site by furthering my knowledge of HTML5 and learning some CSS along the way.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Music Player</h3><p>This was my first project in college and it entailed creating a simple music player in Java.The aim of the project was to gain more experience working with objects and arraylist's but also teamwork.The code from this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/seanmorrissey98/Media-Player" target="_blank">here</a></p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Leader</h2>
    <p>I volunteered myself for the role of <strong>Project Leader</strong> in college. This allowed me to adhere to new skills and challenge's for example teamwork, delegation of work, time management etc. The following projects I took part as Project Leader for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>League-Manager</h3><p>In this Java project we created a league manager for an administrator where the user could create leagues, add teams, record results and generate league tables.The code from this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/seanmorrissey98/League-Manager" target="_blank">here</a></p></li>
      <li><h3>Event-Manager</h3><p>This was an OOP project to build a software solution to manage a booking system for a charitable organisation, allowing them to track the bookings and availability for their facilities and events for set times.The code from this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/seanmorrissey98/Event-Manager" target="_blank">here</a></p></li>
